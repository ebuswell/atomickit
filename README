Atomic Kit is a minimalist library of lock-free atomic functions based on C11
atomics. It is built to be as fast as possible, with as simple and minimal a
code base as possible.

Installation
------------
Link config.def.mk to config.mk, or copy config.def.mk to config.mk and edit
to match your local setup (this is installed under /usr/local by default).
Then enter the following commands:

	make
	sudo make install
